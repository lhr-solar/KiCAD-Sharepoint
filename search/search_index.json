Now, whenever you create a PR, the template checklist will show up for you to fill out. Finally create and switch to a branch called \"RevA\" using the command <code>git switch -c RevA</code>.

Mention the reviewers you requested, and feel free to bug them if they don't respond/review in the next couple of days. To keep the review process quick, you should aim to respond to review comments as fast as possible, but make sure you understand what the reviewers are saying. If you're confused about a concept or technical detail, don't hesitate to ask (as a Github reply).
