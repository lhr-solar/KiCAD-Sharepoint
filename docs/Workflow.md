## Overview
Generally, we aim to follow this workflow when designing PCBs for the car. Sticking to this will help board development go a lot more smoothly
## General Expectations
idk
## Project Setup

First create repo
Then create branch
Then setup shared libraries by cloning submodule
Then create a new KiCad project within your repo
- Add our pull request (PR) template to the main directory of your repository. Now, whenever you create a PR, the template checklist will show up for you to fill out.
## Schematic

## Part Selection
Do this before selecting footprints
Select footprints
## Layout & Routing
Put stuff on board
Edge cuts
Mounting
Planes/Stackup
## Review Process
PCB reviews are handled through Github pull requests.
## Generating Production Files
To generate production files for JLC (Gerbers, BOM, and CPL), use the JLCPCB Tools plugin as described [here](../KiCad-Setup/#kicad-jlcpcb-tools).
## Ordering
Follow the [ordering instructions](../Ordering) to order your PCB prototype using JLCPCB.
timelines for each step - sch, part selection, layout/routing, bom/pos, order. reviewable progress weekly. don't be afraid to ask for reviews/help that's what we're here for....

also how do reviews work + PR etiquette
