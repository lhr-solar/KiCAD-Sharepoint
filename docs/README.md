# Welcome to the KiCad Sharepoint Documentation
Welcome to the LHRs KiCad Sharepoint! KiCad-Sharepoint contains the shared symbols, footprints, and design blocks used to develop our custom PCBs for our solar-powered vehicle. Additionally, this documentation contains helpful guides for setting up and using KiCad with our standardized design process. Any inaccurate or outright wrong information should be blamed on our Platform Lead, Lakshay Gupta. 
## Where to Start
Install and set up KiCad according to these [instructions](./KiCad-Setup/). Before starting a PCB project, make sure to review our expectations for design [standards](./Standards/) and [workflow](./Workflow/). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask your leads. Happy building :)
